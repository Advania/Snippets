## Locally preview your markdown, Github style 

To preview your markdown before each commit I recommend [greadme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/greadme).

To install it tough npm you need to have NodeJS and you can get it here: http://nodejs.org

After install NodeJS you can use this command in cmd:
```
$ npm install -g greadme
```

This install it globally so you can always start it on a .md or .markdown files using this command:
```
$ greadme [path/to/some.markdown]
```

After that the site to `http://localhost:8124/` will start on your default browser and you stop the process by pressing CTRL+C in the cmd

**Plus**: Here is a [Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) if you are not familiar with markdown syntax.
